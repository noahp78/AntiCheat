All opened tickets that are bug reports require a debug log that includes logs of the issue in question. To obtain this, type `/anticheat debug` on your server.

Compiling
-------

AntiCheat builds on Java JDK 1.6 and uses [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to manage dependencies.

To download the source code, first make sure [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is installed, then (from the command line) use
```git clone git@github.com:h31ix/AntiCheat.git```

The source code will be downloaded into a new directory 'AntiCheat'.

Make any changes you desire and then, to compile AntiCheat, ensure you are inside the AntiCheat directory (cd AntiCheat) and use
```mvn clean install```

If all is successful, AntiCheat.jar will be compiled to the 'target' folder and will be ready for use. If you encounter a problem or error, please google search it first and, if you are unable to find an answer, ask a developer.
